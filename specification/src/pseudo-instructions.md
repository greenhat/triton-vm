# Pseudo Instructions

Keeping the instruction set small results in a faster overall proving time due to simpler arithmetization.
Some convenient-to-have instructions are not implemented natively, but are instead simulated using existing instructions.
The following list is a comprehensive overview, including their expansion.


| Instruction    | old OpStack | new OpStack   | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|:---------------|:------------|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nop`          | `_`         | `_`           | Does nothing.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `neg`          | `_ a`       | `_ -a`        | Replaces the top of the stack with the field element corresponding to its additively inverse element.                                                                 |
| `sub`          | `_ b a`     | `_ a-b`       | Subtracts the stack's one-from top element from the stack's topmost element.                                                                                          |
| `is_u32`       | `_ a`       | `_ a`         | Crashes the VM if `a` cannot be represented as an unsigned 32-bit integer.                                                                                            |
| `split_assert` | `_ a`       | `_ lo hi`     | Like instruction `split`, but additionally asserts that the results `lo` and `hi` are, indeed, 32-bit integers. Should be used over `split`.                          |
| `lte`          | `_ b a`     | `_ (a <= b)`  | Tests if the top element on the stack is less than or equal to the one-from top element. Crashes the VM if `a` or `b` is not a 32-bit integer.                        |
| `lt`           | `_ b a`     | `_ (a < b)`   | Tests if the top element on the stack is less than the one-from top element. Crashes the VM if `a` or `b` is not a 32-bit integer.                                    |
| `and`          | `_ b a`     | `_ (a and b)` | Computes the bitwise-and of the top two stack elements. Crashes the VM if `a` or `b` is not a 32-bit integer.                                                         |
| `xor`          | `_ b a`     | `_ (a xor b)` | Computes the bitwise-xor of the top two stack elements. Crashes the VM if `a` or `b` is not a 32-bit integer.                                                         |
| `reverse`      | `_ a`       | `_ b`         | Reverses the bit expansion of the top stack element. Crashes the VM if `a` is not a 32-bit integer.                                                                   |
| `div`          | `_ d n`     | `_ q r`       | Computes division with remainder of the top two stack elements, assuming both arguments are unsigned 32-bit integers. The result satisfies `n == dÂ·q + r`and `r < d`. |
